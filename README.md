# Ishtar
Dockerized Full-Stack Discord Bot in development. The Back-end consists of the chat-bot itself and a Web API which run on NodeJS using DiscordJS and ExpressJS with TypeScript. A web interface written in React serves as the Front-end.

## Legacy
Ishtar used to solely be a Back-end service meant to power other EVE Online applications. A copy of the codebase before the pivot towards a fully-featured full-stack project can be found under `.legacy/`, some of the code from the old codebase is reused for the new back-end.
